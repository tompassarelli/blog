## Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing {#why-is-there-something-rather-than-nothing}

Tom Passarelli (2026). CC0.

Something and nothing are both operations over a domain. Something: some
x is y. Nothing: no x in y. "No milk in the fridge" works because the
fridge is the domain and milk is absent from its contents. "Absolute
nothing" means: no x in y, for all y --- a universal negation requiring
a discourse frame in which "all domains" is a coherent range. The output
constrains against the conditions that make it evaluable. The operation
cannot run.
