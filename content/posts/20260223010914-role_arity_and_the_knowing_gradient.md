_The meaning crisis is not a shortage of knowledge. It is a culture-wide attempt to do arity-3 operations with arity-2 tools._

---


## Prerequisite {#prerequisite}

This paper extends the role-arity framework developed in "Role-Arity and the Structure of Emergence." That paper defines role-arity as the minimum number of functionally distinct slots required for an operation to be well-typed, establishes three thresholds (invariance at arity 1, difference at arity 2, evaluation at arity 3), and develops a diagnostic for question well-formedness based on arity mismatch between a question's structure and its target's. The present paper applies the same framework to a different domain: the structure of knowing, and what happens when a culture systematically underspecifies it.


## The Gradient {#the-gradient}

John Vervaeke identifies four kinds of knowing, presented with increasing depth and decreasing articulability: propositional, procedural, perspectival, participatory. He observes this gradient phenomenologically — the deeper kinds of knowing are harder to talk about, harder to formalize, and more fundamental to meaning. But the gradient itself is unexplained. Why does knowing have this shape? Why is participatory knowing the most fundamental and the hardest to articulate?

The role-arity framework gives a structural answer: the four kinds of knowing operate at different arity levels, and each level is harder to capture from below.


## Propositional Knowing: Arity 2 {#propositional-knowing-arity-2}

Propositional knowing is "knowing that." Paris is the capital of France. Water boils at 100°C. 2 + 2 = 4.

The structure is a partition. A proposition matches a state of affairs or it doesn't. True or false. Correct or incorrect. The proposition sits on one side or the other. Two roles: the claim and the state of affairs it maps to. Arity 2.

This is why propositional knowing is the clearest, the most communicable, the easiest to formalize. It operates at the lowest arity of any knowing type. You can write it down. You can transmit it without loss. You can verify it by checking which side of the partition a claim falls on. The entire apparatus of formal logic is built to manipulate propositional knowledge. The popular image of the scientific method — hypothesis, test, true or false — is a propositional-knowing machine.

Propositional knowing is powerful within its arity. It is also limited to its arity. It can represent any partition, any true/false distinction, any binary mapping. What it cannot do is represent the _process_ by which a partition is established, the _perspective_ from which it is drawn, or the _transformation_ of the knower who draws it. Those are higher-arity operations.


## Procedural Knowing: Arity 3 (Independent Roles) {#procedural-knowing-arity-3--independent-roles}

Procedural knowing is "knowing how." Knowing how to ride a bike. Knowing how to play guitar. Knowing how to debug code. Knowing how to navigate a conversation.

The structure has three roles: a situation (input), a skill or process (evaluator), and a result (output). You encounter a wobbly bike, apply balancing skill, stay upright. You see a bug, apply debugging process, find the cause. Three functionally distinct positions. Arity 3.

This is why procedural knowing is harder to articulate than propositional knowing. The knowledge lives in the process slot — the skill itself — not in any partition. "How do you ride a bike?" cannot be fully answered with propositional statements. You can list propositions about balance, momentum, countersteering. None of them _are_ the skill. The skill is the evaluator role in action, and the evaluator role is not a partition. It is a process that takes input and produces output.

Any attempt to capture procedural knowing propositionally is an attempt to flatten arity 3 into arity 2. That is underspecification. The descriptive format has fewer roles than the phenomenon. This is why instruction manuals are poor substitutes for apprenticeship. The manual gives you propositions (arity 2). The apprenticeship gives you a process (arity 3). The process cannot be fully decomposed into propositions without remainder. There is always something left over — the part that only exists in the doing.

In procedural knowing, the three roles are relatively independent. The skill is stable across applications. Your bike-riding ability doesn't change the nature of bikes. Your debugging process doesn't change the nature of bugs. The evaluator operates on the input and produces output, but the evaluator itself is not transformed by the operation. This independence is what makes procedural knowing more tractable than the deeper kinds — the roles stay in their slots.


## Perspectival Knowing: Arity 3 (Entangled Roles) {#perspectival-knowing-arity-3--entangled-roles}

Perspectival knowing is "knowing what it's like." Knowing what it's like to be in a particular situation. To see from a particular vantage point. To inhabit a particular frame. Not knowing _that_ something is the case, and not knowing _how_ to do something, but knowing what the world looks like from _here_.

The structure is still arity 3: object (input), perspective (evaluator), experience (output). But the relationship between the roles is different from procedural knowing. In procedural knowing, the evaluator is transparent — you look _through_ the skill at the world. In perspectival knowing, the evaluator becomes visible as a role. You become aware that you are looking _through_ something — that the frame is shaping what you see.

This is the critical difference. The perspective is not neutral. It selects, filters, and partially constitutes what counts as relevant. The same city looks different to a tourist, an architect, and a person who grew up there. The "input" (the city) is not independent of the "evaluator" (the perspective). What you see depends on how you're looking, and how you're looking shapes what there is to see. The roles are entangled.

Perspectival knowing is harder to articulate than procedural knowing not because it has more roles — both are arity 3 — but because the roles are no longer separable. You cannot specify the perspective independently of what it reveals, and you cannot specify what is revealed independently of the perspective. Any attempt to describe perspectival knowing propositionally (arity 2) strips out the entanglement. Any attempt to describe it procedurally (arity 3 with independent roles) misses the co-constitution. The fuzziness is not imprecision. It is a structural feature of how the roles relate at this level.

This is where Vervaeke connects knowing to consciousness. Consciousness, on many accounts, is the system becoming aware of its own framing operations — the evaluator becoming visible to itself as an evaluator. That is perspectival knowing. And the difficulty of explaining consciousness — the so-called "hard problem" — may be partly an arity-mismatch problem: we keep trying to explain an entangled-arity-3 phenomenon using propositional (arity 2) and procedural (independent arity 3) tools. The tools don't have the structural capacity to hold the entanglement.


## Participatory Knowing: Arity 3 (Evaluator-Modifying Feedback) {#participatory-knowing-arity-3--evaluator-modifying-feedback}

Participatory knowing is Vervaeke's deepest category. It is the knowing involved in the agent-arena relationship — the knower and the known co-create each other. You do not just have a perspective on the world. You and the world are mutually constituting what each other are. The agent shapes the arena (what counts as relevant, what affords what, what matters) and the arena shapes the agent (what skills develop, what perspectives become available, what kind of knower you become).

The structure is arity 3 with a specific feedback property: the output transforms the evaluator. Not just the input — the evaluator itself. The knower is changed by what they know, and what they can know is changed by what they have become. Each cycle through the loop produces a different system, not just a different result.

This is the structural distinction that matters. In procedural knowing, the output feeds back as input (you debug a second bug using the same process). The evaluator is stable. In perspectival knowing, the evaluator is entangled with the input but remains recognizably the same perspective across applications. In participatory knowing, the evaluator at time T+1 is not the evaluator at time T, because the output of the previous cycle has modified it.

This is why participatory knowing is the hardest to articulate. Every lower-arity description misses something essential:

Propositional (arity 2) misses it entirely. You cannot capture mutual constitution in true/false partitions. "The agent shapes the arena" and "the arena shapes the agent" are individually propositional statements that make sense in isolation. Together they gesture at something their format cannot hold: the simultaneity, the co-dependence, the fact that neither statement is true independently of the other.

Procedural (arity 3, independent roles) misses the feedback to the evaluator. It can describe a skill but not a skill that transforms the skill-holder. It can describe knowing-how but not knowing-how-that-changes-what-you-can-know.

Perspectival (arity 3, entangled roles) gets closer. It captures the co-constitution of frame and framed. But it does not capture the temporal dimension — that the framing operation itself is being transformed by its own outputs over time. A perspective can be entangled with its object and still be the same perspective. Participatory knowing is what happens when the perspective itself evolves through the act of perspecting.

Participatory knowing is arity 3 with evaluator-modifying feedback. The system evaluates, the evaluation changes the system, the changed system evaluates differently, and so on. The "knowing" is not any single state of the loop. It is the trajectory of the loop through its own self-modifications.


## The Actualization Loop {#the-actualization-loop}

This is the structure of transformation. Not transformation as metaphor — transformation as a specific formal property of a feedback loop where the evaluator is modified by its own output.

The hero's journey, stripped of mythological furniture, is a description of this loop.

The hero begins in an ordinary world (initial evaluator state). They encounter a challenge that their current evaluator cannot process — the call to adventure is an input that exceeds the evaluator's capacity. The journey is the process of the evaluator being modified by successive inputs it was not built to handle. The return is the hero arriving back at the starting input with a different evaluator — the ordinary world is the same, but the hero sees it differently because they are different.

This is not arity 3 with simple feedback. It is arity 3 where the evaluator is part of the output. The dragon doesn't just get slain (output). The person who slays the dragon is not the person who set out to slay it (evaluator modification). The journey produces both a result and a different journeyer.

Maslow's self-actualization describes the same structure from a different angle. The actualizing person is not acquiring more propositional knowledge (more true/false partitions). They are not even acquiring more skills (more stable evaluators). They are undergoing a process where their engagement with the world transforms what they are, and what they are transforms their engagement with the world. The hierarchy of needs is a description of which evaluator-states must be achieved before certain kinds of evaluator-modification become possible. You cannot transform your relationship to meaning while your survival evaluator is still in crisis. The lower levels are preconditions for the higher levels to enter the self-modifying loop.

Piaget's developmental stages are the same structure observed in children. Assimilation is the evaluator processing input using its current structure (arity 3 with stable evaluator). Accommodation is the evaluator being modified by input it cannot assimilate (arity 3 with evaluator modification). The transition between developmental stages is not the acquisition of new facts. It is the restructuring of the evaluator itself. The child does not learn that volume is conserved when liquid is poured between containers. The child becomes a different kind of knower — one whose evaluator handles conservation — and conservation becomes visible as a consequence.

The common structure: a system whose evaluative capacity is transformed by the products of its own evaluation. This is what makes it feel like "growth" rather than "learning." Learning adds to what the evaluator processes. Growth changes the evaluator.


## The Meaning Crisis as Arity Mismatch {#the-meaning-crisis-as-arity-mismatch}

Vervaeke's thesis: Western culture has progressively lost access to the higher kinds of knowing. We have optimized for propositional knowing (science, logic, data, facts) and to some extent procedural knowing (skills, techniques, engineering, productivity). We have lost the cultural frameworks — religious, philosophical, communal — that once supported perspectival and participatory knowing. The result is a crisis of meaning. People have more facts and more skills than ever, and feel disconnected from any sense of meaning, relevance, or purpose.

The role-arity framework gives a structural diagnosis: the meaning crisis is a culture-wide arity mismatch. The culture is trying to do arity-3-with-evaluator-modification operations (meaning-making, identity-formation, participatory engagement with reality) using arity-2 tools (propositional frameworks, true/false evaluations, data-driven decision-making, information accumulation).

Meaning is not a proposition. It is not true or false. It is not a fact you can look up. Meaning is the product of participatory knowing — the agent-arena relationship where the knower and the known co-constitute each other. That is an arity-3 operation with evaluator-modifying feedback. No amount of propositional knowledge (arity 2) will produce it, the same way no amount of arity-2 partition structure will produce evaluation. The arity threshold is structural. It cannot be crossed by accumulation at a lower level.

This is why more information does not produce more meaning. More data, more facts, more accurate propositions — these are all arity-2 gains. Meaning requires arity-3-with-evaluator-modification. The gap between them is not quantitative (more vs. less). It is structural (different arity). You cannot stack enough partitions to get an evaluator. You cannot stack enough evaluators to get evaluator-modification. Each threshold is qualitatively different from the one below it.


## Why Modern Interventions Fail {#why-modern-interventions-fail}

The framework predicts which responses to the meaning crisis will work and which will not, based on whether the intervention's arity matches the problem's.

**Propositional interventions (arity 2):** Self-help books that give you propositions about meaning. "Find your purpose." "Live authentically." "Choose happiness." These are true/false statements about meaning, aimed at a phenomenon that is not propositional. They fail because they are arity-2 descriptions of an arity-3 process. Reading a proposition about purpose does not produce the participatory loop that generates purpose. Knowing _that_ you should find meaning does not constitute finding it.

**Procedural interventions (arity 3, independent roles):** Habit-building, skill-acquisition, productivity systems. "Meditate for 10 minutes a day." "Practice gratitude." "Exercise regularly." These are real arity-3 operations — they have input, process, and output. They can change behavior. But the evaluator (the person performing the habit) is treated as stable. The habit is the same each time. The person doing it is expected to benefit from the accumulation of outputs, not from the transformation of themselves. This works for goals that are procedural in nature (get fitter, sleep better, reduce anxiety). It does not work for the meaning crisis, because meaning requires evaluator modification, not evaluator repetition. A person who meditates for ten minutes a day using a procedural approach will become calm. They will not necessarily become someone for whom calmness opens into a different relationship with reality.

**Perspectival interventions (arity 3, entangled roles):** Therapy, reframing, psychedelic experiences, travel to unfamiliar cultures. These operate at the right arity and introduce entanglement — the perspective and the perceived are acknowledged as co-constitutive. Therapy, at its best, does not give you propositions about your problems. It gives you a different frame through which to perceive them, and the new frame changes what the problems are. This is closer. It addresses the right level. But perspectival interventions can stall if they do not reach evaluator modification. You can acquire a new perspective and still be the same knower — someone who now has two frames instead of one, but whose fundamental evaluative structure is unchanged. Perspective-collecting is not the same as transformation.

**Participatory interventions (arity 3, evaluator-modifying feedback):** Sustained contemplative practice, philosophical dialogue that transforms the participants, apprenticeship under someone who embodies a different way of knowing, long-term creative work that changes the creator, committed relationships that transform both parties. These work — when they work — because they operate at the right arity with the right feedback structure. The evaluator is modified by the process. The person who emerges is not the person who entered. The transformation is not a side effect. It is the point.

Vervaeke's own prescription for the meaning crisis centers on practices — _practica_ — that transform the practitioner. Dialogue. Contemplation. Embodied engagement. The role-arity framework predicts this. It predicts that the intervention must match the arity of the problem, and that the meaning crisis is an arity-3-with-evaluator-modification problem. Any intervention at a lower arity will produce results at that arity (more facts, better habits, new perspectives) without addressing the structural deficit (the absence of a self-modifying participatory loop that generates meaning).


## The Arity Sub-Levels {#the-arity-sub-levels}

The four kinds of knowing do not map onto four distinct arities. They map onto arity 2 and three sub-levels of arity 3, differentiated by the feedback relationship between evaluator and output:

| Knowing type  | Arity | Feedback structure                                                               | Articulability                                                     |
|---------------|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Propositional | 2     | None. Partition. True/false.                                                     | High. Can be fully stated in propositions.                         |
| Procedural    | 3     | Output feeds back as input. Evaluator stable.                                    | Moderate. Can be demonstrated, partially described.                |
| Perspectival  | 3     | Evaluator and input entangled. Evaluator visible but stable across applications. | Low. Can be gestured at, evoked, shared through shared experience. |
| Participatory | 3     | Output modifies the evaluator. Evaluator transformed by its own products.        | Minimal. Can only be undergone.                                    |

The articulability gradient follows directly from the arity structure. Each sub-level of arity 3 is harder to capture from arity 2 (propositional description) because it adds a feedback relationship that propositions cannot represent. Propositions can state that a process exists (procedural). They can state that a perspective shapes perception (perspectival). They can state that the knower is transformed by knowing (participatory). But the _stating_ is arity 2, and the _phenomenon_ is arity 3 with increasing feedback complexity. The gap between the stating and the phenomenon grows with each sub-level.

This is the knowing gradient. It is not mysterious. It is not a failure of language or cognition. It is a structural consequence of trying to describe higher-arity phenomena using lower-arity tools. The fuzziness of participatory knowing is not imprecision. It is the predictable result of arity mismatch between the description and the described.


## The Dependency Direction {#the-dependency-direction}

The four kinds of knowing form a dependency chain, but the dependency runs in the opposite direction from the articulability gradient.

Propositional knowing presupposes procedural knowing. You cannot establish that a proposition is true without a process of verification — an arity-3 operation that takes the proposition and the world as input and produces a verdict. The proposition (arity 2) does not verify itself. Verification is evaluation. Evaluation is arity 3.

Procedural knowing presupposes perspectival knowing. A skill operates within a frame — it takes certain things as relevant and ignores others. Debugging presupposes that the code, the error, and the expected behavior are the relevant features of the situation. That selection of relevance is a perspectival operation. The skill is not neutral. It embeds a perspective on what matters. Without the perspective, the skill has no domain to operate in.

Perspectival knowing presupposes participatory knowing. A perspective does not arrive from nowhere. It is the product of the knower's history of engagement with the world — the accumulated trajectory of an evaluator-modifying feedback loop. Your perspective on a city is shaped by years of living in it, and those years were shaped by the perspective you brought to them. The perspective exists because a participatory process produced it.

So: propositional depends on procedural depends on perspectival depends on participatory. The most articulable depends on the least articulable. The easiest to formalize depends on the hardest to formalize. The thing we can write down depends on the thing we can only undergo.

The meaning crisis is what happens when a culture optimizes the top of this chain (more propositions, better procedures) while neglecting the bottom (the participatory processes that generate the perspectives that ground the procedures that verify the propositions). The chain does not break at the top. It breaks at the bottom. And when it breaks, the top keeps functioning — you still have facts and skills — but the facts feel meaningless and the skills feel pointless. That is not a propositional problem. It is a participatory one.


## Compact Summary {#compact-summary}

The four kinds of knowing — propositional, procedural, perspectival, participatory — operate at different arity levels and sub-levels. Propositional knowing is arity 2 (partition). Procedural knowing is arity 3 with stable evaluator. Perspectival knowing is arity 3 with evaluator-input entanglement. Participatory knowing is arity 3 with evaluator-modifying feedback.

The articulability gradient exists because each sub-level adds a feedback relationship that lower-arity descriptions cannot represent. The fuzziness of participatory knowing is not imprecision. It is the predictable result of describing an arity-3-with-evaluator-modification phenomenon using arity-2 tools.

The meaning crisis is a culture-wide arity mismatch: arity-3-with-evaluator-modification problems addressed with arity-2 tools. More information does not produce more meaning because information is arity 2 and meaning is arity 3. The gap is structural, not quantitative.

The hero's journey, self-actualization, and Piagetian accommodation all describe the same formal structure: a system whose evaluative capacity is transformed by the products of its own evaluation. This is what distinguishes growth from learning. Learning adds to what the evaluator processes. Growth changes the evaluator.

The dependency direction runs opposite to the articulability gradient. Propositional depends on procedural depends on perspectival depends on participatory. The culture has optimized the top of the chain while neglecting the bottom. The result is a system that produces facts and skills efficiently but cannot generate the meaning that makes facts and skills feel worth having.

Interventions match or mismatch the problem's arity. Propositional interventions (self-help books) fail. Procedural interventions (habit-building) produce behavioral change without transformation. Perspectival interventions (therapy, reframing) can shift the frame without modifying the evaluator. Only participatory interventions (sustained practice that transforms the practitioner) operate at the right arity with the right feedback structure.

One role: something is true or false. Three roles, stable evaluator: something is done skillfully. Three roles, entangled: something is seen from here. Three roles, evaluator-modified: someone becomes different through knowing.
